C Run-time
==========

``debug-message`` no longer crashes when printing some conditions.


Common Dylan
============

The ``<timer>`` class has been renamed to ``<profiling-timer>``.


Testworks
=========

Compiler warnings are now produced when a test or suite is unused.
For example, it is easy to forget to add a test to any suite.  As a
side effect of this change, it is now necessary to organize test suite
code in a bottom-up style.  That is, you must define tests and suites
*before* including them in a suite definition in your source file.  If
you don't, you will receive a warning about an "Illegal forward
reference".
